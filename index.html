<div class="byline">
  <p>2010-08-02 - 21:22</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>I&#8217;ve been banging on to anyone who&#8217;d listen for ages now about how
<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is going the be the Next Big Thing. I read a fair way
into Stuart Halloway&#8217;s <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a>, and I played in the
REPL a bit here and there, but I never got around to doing anything
serious with it.</p>

<p>Today I finally found an excuse to use Clojure at work for a
real-world problem. I needed to write a small program to read a
product feed in CSV format, and cross-check that all the products in
the feed actually exist in the live product catalogue database.</p>

<p>Here is my somewhat naïve attempt at implementing a solution:</p>

<pre><code>;;
;; Read a CSV file and look up the product ids it contains in a
;; database. Report all the products in the CSV that do not exist in
;; the database.
;;
;; Usage: &#036;0 &lt;path-to-csv-file&gt;
;;

(import 'java.io.FileReader 'au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVReader)

(use 'clojure.contrib.str-utils)
(use 'clojure.contrib.sql)

;; OpenCSV gives us a List of String[]s... ugh.
(defn read-csv [file-name]
  (with-open [reader (CSVReader. (FileReader. file-name))]
     (rest ;; skip the header row
      (map seq (seq (. reader readAll))))))

;; extract interesting fields from a CSV row
(defn product-from [row]
  {:product-id (nth row  0 "")
   :title      (nth row  1 "")})

;; set up the db connection
(def db {:classname   "org.h2.Driver"
         :subprotocol "h2"
         :subname (str "file:///Users/mrowe/.h2data/mydata")
         :user     "sa"
         :password ""})

(defn sql-query [q]
  (with-query-results res q (doall res)))

(defn count-products [product-id]
  (:count
   (first
    (sql-query ["select count(1) as count from product where id = ?" product-id]))))

(defn exists? [product-id]
   (&gt;= (count-products product-id) 1))

(defn product-missing? [csv-row]
  (let [product (product-from csv-row)]
    (not (exists? (product :product-id)))))

;;;;;;;;;;

(def filename (first *command-line-args*))
(def feed (read-csv filename))

(defn report-product-id [row]
  (let [product (product-from row)]
    (format "Not in product catalog: %s - %s" (product :product-id) (product :title))))

(with-connection db 
  (println (str-join "\n" (map report-product-id (filter product-missing? feed)))))
</code></pre>

<p>This was purely an exercise in thinking functionally, and figuring out
the basics of driving Clojure and getting it to interact with the
world around it. I&#8217;ve made no attempt to actually use one of Clojure&#8217;s
headline features, concurrency. (For what it&#8217;s worth, it happily
processes an input of 2500 rows in a few seconds, most of which is
spent in the database&#8212;I doubt there&#8217;s much to be gained from
parallelising it.) But I think it reads pretty well, and is at least
as concise and expressive as the equivalent Ruby would have been&#8212;once
you learn to see through all the parentheses. ;-)</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

<div class="byline">
  <p>2009-10-17 - 15:53</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> has a &#8220;shared folders&#8221; feature which allows you to
seamlessly share folders on the host Mac system with the virtualised
guest OS. With a Linux guest, <code>vmware-tools</code> will install the
&#8220;Host-Guest File System&#8221; (<code>hgfs</code>) driver and add an entry to
<code>/etc/fstab</code> to automagically mount all shared folders under
<code>/mnt/hgfs</code>. </p>

<p>This is great, but unless your user id in the Linux guest happens to
match your user id OS X, you will not be able to access the mounted
directories as a regular user. Luckily, you can get the hgfs driver to
mount the shared folders as your user. Edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> as root:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; sudo vi /etc/fstab
</code></pre>

<p>and look for a section like:</p>

<pre><code># Beginning of the block added by the VMware software
.host:/ /mnt/hgfs vmhgfs defaults,ttl=5 0 0
# End of the block added by the VMware software
</code></pre>

<p>Add options for <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Beginning of the block added by the VMware software
.host:/ /mnt/hgfs vmhgfs defaults,ttl=5,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
# End of the block added by the VMware software
</code></pre>

<p>The values I&#8217;ve used, 1000 for uid and gid, are the defaults for the
first user created on an Ubuntu desktop install. To find the correct
values for your user, run the <code>id</code> command in the guest OS:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; id
uid=1000(mrowe) gid=1000(mrowe) groups=...

<h2><a href="http://mikerowecode.com/2009/09/filter-in-modern-languages.html">Filtering lists </a></h2>
<div class="byline">
  <p>2009-09-24 - 08:44</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>Recently, my friend Gav wrote about <a href="http://antonym.org/2009/09/stl-filtering.html">using STL to filter a vector of
values in C++</a> in which he explained a surprising gotcha. I&#8217;m sure
he knows what he&#8217;s talking about, but it struck me how <em>ugly</em> this
(presumably idomatic) code was. So I figured I&#8217;d see what it would
look like in a few more &#8220;modern&#8221; languages:</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; numbers = 1..9
=&gt; 1..9
&gt;&gt; numbers.reject { |n| n.even? }
=&gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you skip the separate assignment of the input data:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; (1..9).reject { |n| n.even? }
=&gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<h3>Python</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = range(1,10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [n for n in numbers if n % 2]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [n for n in range(1, 10) if n % 2]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<h3><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a></h3>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (def numbers (range 1 10))
#'user/numbers
user=&gt; (filter odd? numbers)
(1 3 5 7 9)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (filter odd? (range 1 10))
(1 3 5 7 9)
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, I get that this wasn&#8217;t the point of the original post&#8212;sometimes
you&#8217;re just stuck with C++. But if you do have the choice, other
languages can be far more expressive for this common kind of list
processing.</p>

<p>If you have examples in other languages (or improvements to my
efforts) <a href="mailto:mowe@mojain.com">send them in</a> and I&#8217;ll post them here.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: From <a href="http://www.rawblock.com">Julian Doherty</a>:</p>

<h3>Erlang</h3>

<pre><code>1&gt; Numbers = lists:seq(1,9).
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
2&gt; [X || X &lt;- Numbers, X rem 2 =/= 0].

<div class="story">
  <p>Bash completion, the magic that allows you to start typing the name of
a file, directory, etc. in bash then press TAB to complete it, can be
taught new tricks, including knowing about your git repository. But if
you&#8217;re on a Mac, the magic is not installed by defaut.</p>

<p>If you are running git from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, you probably don&#8217;t have the
bash_completion variant installed. You can install it with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install git-core +bash_completion
</code></pre>

<p>If you <em>do</em> already have git installed without this variant, you&#8217;ll
probably need to deactivate it first:</p>

<pre><code>sudo port deactivate git-core
</code></pre>

<p>Then reinstall with the variants you need:</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install git-core +bash_completion +gitweb +svn +doc
</code></pre>

<p>You can then activate completion by adding the following to your
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if [ -f /opt/local/etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /opt/local/etc/bash_completion
fi

<h2><a href="http://mikerowecode.com/2009/05/jaoo-2009.html">A potted history of JAOO 2009</a></h2>
<div class="byline">
  <p>2009-05-27 - 22:37</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>A couple of weeks ago I attend the <a href="http://jaoo.com.au/brisbane-2009/">JAOO 2009</a> conference in
Brisbane. What follows is a biased, incomplete and probably misleading
account of my impression of the two days.</p>

<h4>Keynote</h4>

<p>I always assumed conference keynotes were meant to be broad, sweeping
and inspiring. This one was narrow, technical and delivered in a
mind-numbing monotone. Maybe it&#8217;s just the way they do things now?</p>

<h4>Introduction to Objective-C</h4>

<p>This was clearly targeted at people who have no exposure to
Objective-C, but rather than just being a dry survey of the language
syntax and libraries, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> provided a nice historical
overview of the Objective-C and its heritage.</p>

<p>My take away: Objective-C is basically SmallTalk, and SmallTalk is
basically Lisp.</p>

<h4>Google App Engine: Building an App the Google Way</h4>

<p>Pamela got rave reviews in Sydney, and she&#8217;s certainly an entertaining
speaker. If you&#8217;d never heard of GAE, or never looked at its
capabilities, this would have been a very good introduction. I&#8217;ve
built a couple of small GAE apps though (in Python), and other than
seeing the Java version of some of the APIs, this talk really told me
nothing new.</p>

<h4>1,001 Iterations: Product Design, Illustrated</h4>

<p>This was a recounting of the process <a href="http://avibryant.com/">Avi Bryant</a> went through
taking a new idea from its inception through many refinements to a
polished product.</p>

<p>Perhaps most the interesting part for me was Avi&#8217;s assessment of the
relative strengths of the various languages he ended up using to
implement the product:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> - for &#8220;thinking&#8221; in (i.e. the interesting problems and
            their solutions)</p></li>
<li><p>Java - for nuts-and-bolts computing (crunching numbers)</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby - for interfacing with external libraries and APIs (e.g. twitter)</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript - for interacting with the user</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s always a good idea to mix so many technologies in
the one product, but it certainly makes some sense to not get hung up
on the One True Language, and just use each where they&#8217;re best suited.</p>

<h4>Speeding Ducks</h4>

<p>Avi again. Much more technical this time. Avi&#8217;s main point: Ruby
really is slow, but there&#8217;s no reason it has to be.</p>

<p>He began with an interesting history of Java&#8217;s Hotspot VM, which was
based on technology developed for SmallTalk and Self in the 1980s. But
Google&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> was built by three people in about 3 months&#8212;surely we
can do the same for ruby!</p>

<p>At the end of the talk, Avi was challenged by Joshua Bloch. Josh
disputed Avi&#8217;s claim that because V8 was built in three months, <em>all</em>
optimising &#8220;hotspot&#8221; VMs should be easy to build. Java&#8217;s current VM
has been constantly improved over many years, and solves many
non-trivial problems.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of interaction between notable figures in our
industry is exactly why you go to conferences like JAOO.</p>

<h4>Hey You! Get On To My Cloud! - Application Development in the Clouds</h4>

<p>Dave Thomas gave us some thought provoking ideas about current
languages development platforms. Is JavaScript the way of the future?
I&#8217;m not so sure, but I think one of Dave&#8217;s main points is worth paying
attention to: functional programming is the way forward if we want to
improve the speed with which we can build software.</p>

<h4>Atlassian</h4>

<p><a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/rebelutionary">Mike Cannon-Brookes</a> gave us a bit of background of Atlassian&#8217;s
history (they&#8217;ve gone from two people and one product to nearly 100
engineers and ten products in eight years), then listed what he
thought were the ten key practices that have made them successful.
I&#8217;ll excerpt just the ones I think are worth talking about, and add my
thoughts (not necessarily agreeing with Mike):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Agile - it&#8217;s the <em>principles</em> that are important, not any
particular methodology or set of tools</p></li>
<li><p>Code review - there&#8217;s plenty of hard evidence that code
review/inspection is one of the best ways to reduce the number of
defects in software. Of course, pairing is the ultimate form of
code review.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimise tests - the main goal: get feedback to developers as fast
as possible. Some of the things Atlassian do to achieve this
include selectively running only tests that could possibly be
affected by a code change (by doing static analysis on coverage),
and splitting functional tests into parallel builds.</p>

<p>This is a common problem&#8212;functional test suites that take so long
to test an application that the pipeline from code check-in to the
&#8220;you broke the build!&#8221; feedback can be hours. Atlassian&#8217;s solution
is to split the tests into chunks that run in a maximum of ten
minutes, and have enough build agents to run all the chunks in
parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>Put everything in a wiki. Yeah, they would say that, wouldn&#8217;t they?
:-)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Dev speed posse&#8221; - Atlassian have a small team that spend a fixed
amount of time every week just focusing on removing things that
slow down development. This is a great idea (although not one
that&#8217;s unique to Atlassian), and something more organisations
should consider. One of the more interesting goals they have is
that the &#8220;checkout loop&#8221; (the time it takes a developer to go from
a clean machine to having a checked out app running locally and
ready to work on) should be no more than ten minutes. How many
large development shops can achieve that?</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Josh Bloch - Effective Java</h4>

<p>This was basically a summary of some of the new things in the second
edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321356683?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikerowecode-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321356683">Effective Java</a>. About a third of the talk was all about
generics. Good grief. Surely someone has noticed by now that this has
all gone horribly wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Concurrency is hard&#8221; - even if you use the right APIs (for example,
always use <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> not <code>Collections.synchronized*()</code>) it&#8217;s
still easy to get it wrong. Read Brian Goetz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikerowecode-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321349601">Java Concurrency in Practice</a>. </p>

<p>And finally: <code>Serializable</code> is bad, since it allows objects to be
created without using constructors. This can lead to invariants and
other assumptions being violated. Josh says to use serialization
proxies instead.</p>

<h4>Doug Crockford on JavaScript</h4>

<p>One of the classic Doug Crockford JavaScript talks. Probably nothing
new if you&#8217;d listened to his talks from Yahoo&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theater</a>, but
still well worth spending 45 minutes listening to in person.</p>

<p>Some of Doug&#8217;s comments, observations and tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JavaScript has widest range of user programming skills of any
language, from computers scientist to cut-and-pasters</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript has many influences, including: Self (prototypes,
dynamic typing), Scheme (lambda, loose typing), Java (syntax), Perl
(regexps)</p></li>
<li><p>it is commonly being used as a functional language&#8212;you&#8217;ll write
better JavaScript if you think functionally</p></li>
<li><p><code>eval</code> is the most misused feature - just don&#8217;t do it!</p></li>
<li><p>always use <code>===</code>. You&#8217;ll be tempted to use <code>==</code> instead, but it&#8217;s
broken&#8212;it causes type coercion, which leads to unexpected and
buggy results</p></li>
<li><p>manage the divide between client and server (don&#8217;t recreate the
server in the browser)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Software Visualization and Model Generation</h4>

<p><a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/">Eric Doernenburg</a> is a consultant at ThoughtWorks, and I&#8217;d heard him talk before
about some of the cool code visualisation tools he&#8217;s put together. The
basic idea is that by visualising certain attributes of a code base,
it&#8217;s much easier to focus on the trouble spots without getting lost in
the detail of thousands of lines of code.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Eric uses both common tools (e.g. CheckStyle) and the
more exotic (<a href="http://www.inf.unisi.ch/faculty/lanza/codecrawler.html">CodeCrawler</a>, <a href="http://www.inf.unisi.ch/phd/wettel/codecity.html">CodeCity</a>). Those last two are more
or less self-contained, but Eric does really cool things with
CheckStyle and <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>, and a bit of XSL to glue them together.
As a general approach, use whatever analysis tool is closest to what
you need, then map the output into a format your visualisation tool
can read.</p>

<h4>Smart Software with F#</h4>

<p>An overview of, and small sample app, in F#, Microsoft&#8217;s functional
language for the CLR. The main message:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>F# is great for data-intensive applications</p></li>
<li><p>smart algorithms are (relatively) easy in F#</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both of which apply to any functional language of course.</p>

<p>You try to give Microsoft people the benefit of the doubt&#8230; but <a href="http://callvirt.net/blog/">Joel Pobar</a>, 
despite obviously being very knowledgeable about F# and
functional programming, still managed a couple of clangers. Most
egregious: he called python an &#8220;elementary imperative language&#8221;. Fair
enough if your background is Visual Basic and you&#8217;d never heard of
functional programming&#8230; but this guy is the F# expert.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was good to see a bit of F# in action. If it gets more
people thinking about functional programming, great. But it doesn&#8217;t
offer anything you can&#8217;t get in Clojure, SmallTalk, Scheme, etc.,
unless you&#8217;re stuck in the Microsoft ecosystem.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall, a great couple of days. I learnt new things and expanded my
mind about things I already knew. I hope to go again next year, and
hopefully it will come to Melbourne!</p>

<div class="story">
  <p>When you&#8217;re writing or coding, you want to remove as many distractions
as possible. In addition to obvious things like shutting down you
email, IM and twitter clients, it can be helpful to put your editor in
full-screen mode. This way, the editor is the only thing visible, so
your attention isn&#8217;t drawn to menu bars, flashing notifications or
bouncing dock icons.</p>

<p>To create a shortcut for fullscreen mode in emacs, put this in your
<code>~/.emacs</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>(defun toggle-fullscreen ()
  (interactive)
  (set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen (if (frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen)
                                           nil
                                           'fullboth)))
(global-set-key [(meta return)] 'toggle-fullscreen)
</code></pre>

<p>Now pressing <code>M-return</code> (usually <code>alt + return</code> on Windows/Linux or <code>⌘
+ return</code> on a Mac) will toggle Emacs between normal and full screen
mode.</p>

<h2><a href="http://mikerowecode.com/2008/03/git_with_subversion.html">Using git on subversion projects</a></h2>
<div class="byline">
  <p>2008-06-01 - 21:12</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>Despite all the noise lately about distributed version control
systems, the chances are any given project you want to work on today
will be using Subversion. But that&#8217;s OK, you can still get the benefit
of all the advanced features of <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> by using it as a &#8220;front end&#8221; to
subversion. </p>

<p>Before I get into the &#8220;how&#8221;, why would you want to do this?</p>

<p>The most obvious benefits are having a full local history, and cheap
local branching. It&#8217;s trivial in git to create branches for features
you&#8217;re working on, and then easily switch between them. Say you&#8217;re
working on a feature for the next release, and an urgent bug for 1.0
comes in. Simply:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git commit -m "work in progress"
&#036; git checkout --track -b fix-urgent-bug-1234 release-1.0

...hack hack...

&#036; git commit -m "fixed bug #1234"
&#036; git checkout cool-feature-foo
</code></pre>

<p>and continue where you left off.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a bunch of other neat stuff in git that I miss whenever I
have to use something else (keep in mind that I&#8217;m no svn guru, so
there may be similar things in svn if you look hard enough. But I very
much doubt they&#8217;re as fast). <code>git grep</code> for rapidly searching source
trees. <code>gitk</code> for visualising branches and interactively searching for
commit messages and changes. Local commits. Oh, and everything is
<em>much</em> faster.</p>

<p>OK, on to the <strong>how</strong>.</p>

<p>We start by checking out the svn repo:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn clone -s http://svn.example.com/svn/cool-project
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-s</code> switch means &#8220;standard layout&#8221;, i.e. the recommended
subversion usage of trunk/branches/tags. If your project doesn&#8217;t
follow this convention, you can specify the names of the
subdirectories used:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn clone --trunk=MAIN --branches=branches --tags=releases \
    http://svn.example.com/svn/cool-project
</code></pre>

<p>There are lots of other options to clone that can help if you have a
really non-standard repo to work with. Check the <code>init</code> command in
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">man git-svn(1)</a>.</p>

<p>You should now have the HEAD of trunk in a directory called
&#8220;cool-protect&#8221;. (You can specify a different target directory name by
appending it to the <code>git svn clone</code> command.)</p>

<p>The full power of git is now at your command! You can grep the source
tree:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git grep '^class Model('
django/db/models/base.py:class Model(object):
tests/modeltests/invalid_models/models.py:class Model(models.Model):
</code></pre>

<p>Find the git commit corresponding to a subversion revision:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn find-rev r1234
c5dfec042453672a27fd19ff81131edd01145584

&#036; git show c5dfec0
commit c5dfec042453672a27fd19ff81131edd01145584
Author: Michael Rowe &lt;mrowe@mojain.com&gt;
Date:   Sat Feb 16 10:14:57 2008 +1100
...
</code></pre>

<p>And interrogate the full history of the repo:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; cd ~/src/django
&#036; git log '@{3 weeks ago}' -1
commit 696a3322d6709ebffcc436eb6188ea4d769ebfc5
Author: mtredinnick &lt;mtredinnick@bcc190cf-cafb-0310-a4f2-bffc1f526a37&gt;
Date:   Mon Feb 4 04:57:56 2008 +0000

    Fixed a simple TODO item in one error path of the "extends" tag.
</code></pre>

<p>In the time we&#8217;ve been playing with this, maybe some changes have been
committed upstream. To make sure our local repository is up to date, we
rebase:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn rebase
</code></pre>

<p>You could also just use <code>git svn fetch</code> to fetch the upstream changes
into the repo without rebasing your working tree. In general, I would
avoid this unless you know what you are doing, since it can make
things complicated when you go to merge and push your changes
upstream. If you are working on the main trunk of the svn repo,
<code>rebase</code> is almost always what you want.</p>

<p>So now we have an up to date checkout, lets get to work! As you work,
add files to git&#8217;s &#8220;index&#8221; and commit to the repo. Commits in git are
fast, and should be used almost as frequently as saving a file in your
editor. You can always consolidate these &#8220;micro-commits&#8221; into larger
feature or bug fix commits later.</p>

<pre><code>...hack hack...

&#036; git add src/module.py src/other.py
&#036; git commit -m "I did stuff"
</code></pre>

<p>and repeat.</p>

<p><em>Note for subversion users</em>: you have to tell git about every file you
change, even if it&#8217;s not a new file. Details of git usage are beyond
the scope of this article (there are some <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/QuickStart">excellent starting points</a>),
but be aware that you have to <code>git add</code> each file you
want included in a commit.</p>

<p>(<em>Note for lazy git users</em>: This can be combined into a single
command for existing files:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git commit -m "I did stuff" src/module.py src/other.py
</code></pre>

<p>but I tend to prefer the two-step approach for anything but the most
trivial changes.)</p>

<p>As you work, you can periodically sync with the upstream subversion
repo to get other people&#8217;s changes:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn rebase
</code></pre>

<p>This won&#8217;t work if you have any local uncommitted changes. However,
you can &#8220;stash&#8221; them away temporarily (in git 1.5.3 and later):</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git stash
&#036; git svn rebase
&#036; git stash apply
</code></pre>

<p>In any case, as mentioned above, you want to commit locally as often
as possible.</p>

<p>When you have finished work on a feature or bug fix that you want to
push back to the subversion repository, make sure all your changes are
committed locally to git (<code>git status</code>), then review what you&#8217;ve done:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git log origin/trunk (by default, or whatever svn branch you're on)
&#036; git diff origin/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, when you are happy with the work you&#8217;ve done and are ready to
push it up to subversion:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git svn dcommit
</code></pre>

<p>This will create individual svn check ins for each git commit since the
last upstream revision. If you want to combine local commits into one
large svn check in (e.g. because you followed my advice above and made
frequent local commits), the interactive rebase command will help:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git rebase --interactive origin/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Interactive rebase opens an editor with a list of all the commits
since the revision you specify (<code>remotes/trunk</code> in our example).</p>

<pre><code>pick d79a908 A small change to a file
pick c5dfec0 An unrelated change
pick db0346b Fix typo in hello
</code></pre>

<p>To combine the typo fix into the first commit, move its line directly
below the line for the first commit and change &#8220;pick&#8221; to &#8220;squash&#8221;:</p>

<pre><code>pick d79a908 A small change to a file
squash db0346b Fix typo in hello
pick c5dfec0 An unrelated change
</code></pre>

<p>The result will be two commits (<code>d79a908</code> and <code>c5dfec0</code>), with
<code>d79a908</code> incorporating the changes from <code>db0346b</code>. You can do this
for multiple consecutive lines if you want to combine many commits
into one. See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">man git-rebase(1)</a> for full details.</p>

<p>Now use <code>git svn dcommit</code> as above to push the revised commits
upstream.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working on a single branch so far, but one of the big
benefits of using git is the cheap branching. Lets start work on a new
experimental feature:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git checkout -b my-wacky-feature
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-b</code> switch means create a new branch. Without that, <code>git
checkout</code> switches to an existing branch. </p>

<pre><code>...hack hack...

&#036; git add ...
&#036; git commit ...
</code></pre>

<p>At any time, we can commit locally and switch to another branch:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git checkout other-thing-to-work-on

...hack hack...

&#036; git add ...
&#036; git commit ...
</code></pre>

<p>then switch back and continue where we were:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git checkout my-wacky-feature
</code></pre>

<p>All of the commands we&#8217;ve discussed operate on the current branch
(unless you specify otherwise). So you can grep for strings, get
change logs and diffs and view visual history all in the context of
the branch. You can also diff the current branch with another. To get
a diff from <code>release-1.0</code> to the current working tree (on branch
<code>fix-urgent-bug-1234</code>):</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git checkout fix-urgent-bug-1234
&#036; git diff release-1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Or to get diffs between arbitrary branches and revisions (without
having to checkout either branch):</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git diff release-1.0..my-wacky-feature
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">man git-diff(1)</a> for all the options to diff.</p>

<p><code>git svn dcommit</code> will only push changes on the current branch up to
the subversion repository, so you can clean up and consolidate your
commits using rebase, then push them back to subversion when they&#8217;re
ready.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope this quick introduction has whet your appetite for combining
the power of git with the ubiquity of subversion. There is much more
to git (we haven&#8217;t touched on merging at all), and once you&#8217;ve dipped
your feet in, I recommend reading the intros and man pages at the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitDocumentation">git site</a>.</p>

<div class="byline">
  <p>2008-06-01 - 20:55</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html">Spaces</a> was one of the most anticipated features in Leopard, at
least for Unix/X11 refugees like myself. X has had virtual desktops
for decades, but users of &#8220;mainstream&#8221; desktop operating systems (i.e.
Windows and Mac OS X) have had to rely on third-party utilities to get
the same functionality.</p>

<p>In the case of OS X, Leopard was set to change that with Spaces.
Unfortunately, the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/why_apple_spaces_is_broken">implementation was broken</a> in such a way as to
make it incredibly frustrating to use the way I&#8217;m used to using X11. I
typically have Terminal and Safari (and often <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Emacs</a>) windows open
on multiple desktops. But on a desktop dedicated to a particular task,
I want to be able to ⌘-⇥ (command-tab) between application windows on
that desktop. Prior to 10.5.3, this would invariably do precisely the
opposite of what I wanted, and flip to <em>another</em> desktop that had a
window of that application open. This resulted in Spaces being about
5% as useful as X11 for serious keyboard-oriented work.</p>

<p><em>(For what it&#8217;s worth, this whole thing is mostly an issue because of
the distinction OS X makes between apps and windows of apps&#8212;in X11,
alt-tab usually cycles between all windows equally, regardless of what
application they belong to. On OS X however, command-tab cycles
between applications&#8212;⌘-` can be used to cycle between
windows of an application.)</em></p>

<p>But good news! The recent 10.5.3 update to Mac OS X fixes it! Contrary
to what <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/spaces">Gruber says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Y]ou shouldn’t notice any changes, because the default behavior
remains the same in 10.5.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the default behaviour <em>has</em> changed: command-tabbing between
applications now stays on the same desktop if the target application
has a window there, and jumps to another desktop otherwise.</p>

<p>This is just about perfect. I actually like the jump-to-desktop
behaviour for applications that aren&#8217;t on multiple desktops (e.g.
iTunes), but now the default is to stay on-desktop for apps that are.
(I still think I&#8217;d be slighly more comfortable if OS X behaved the
same way as X11, and treated all windows as equal&#8212;but that could be
Just What I&#8217;m Used To.)</p>

<p>Thanks Apple!</p>

back to the client. I&#8217;d be interested to
<a href="mailto:mikerowe@mikerowecode.com">hear</a> about experiences with other
readers.</p>

<h3>A word about what&#8217;s behind curtain</h3>

<p>The new site is built from text files using the <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a>
publishing system. The text files are formated using John Gruber&#8217;s
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, with punctuation fixed by his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a>.</p>

<p>I use a number of plugins for blosxom to get things working the way I
want. These include <code>archives</code> and <code>recententries</code> to provide the
navigation options in the sidebar, <code>entries_index</code> to maintain article
time stamps and <code>atomfeed</code> to produce, er, an <a href="http://mikerowecode.com/index.atom">atom feed</a>. :) </p>

<p>Blosxom runs in &#8220;static&#8221; mode to generate the site locally, and then I
<code>rsync</code> it to my web server, where it&#8217;s served as static HTML.</p>

<h4>Why blosxom?</h4>

<p>It probably seems like a strange choice, when there are so many
&#8220;advanced&#8221; alternatives such as <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (which was my previous
system), WordPress, MovableType, Blogger, etc., etc. But a couple of
things convinced me that blosxom was the way to go.</p>

<p>First, my needs are minimal. I just want to publish the stuff I write with
the minimum of fuss and overhead. I wanted a publishing system that
would get out of the way.</p>

<p>Second, there is something very appealing about keeping things in
plain text. I can write in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> (which is of course the One True
Editor), manage changes with <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, search with grep (or
spotlight). The directory layout is the same on my hard disk as on the
public server. There&#8217;s no database to worry about backing up.</p>

<p>Finally, since I&#8217;m serving static HTML, in the (admittedly
far-fetched) event that this site becomes wildly popular and sees huge
amounts of traffic, scaling will be trivial. :)</p>

<h2><a href="http://mikerowecode.com/2008/01/reviewboard_with_djblets.html">Reviewboard git mirror</a></h2>
<div class="byline">
  <p>2008-01-17 - 16:04</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>For some months now, I&#8217;ve been maintaining a <a href="http://git.mojain.com/w/mirrors/reviewboard.git">git mirror</a> of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/">Reviewboard</a> project&#8217;s <a href="http://reviewboard.googlecode.com/svn/">svn repository</a>. The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">git-svn</a> tool works really well for this, except for one small wrinkle: the reviewboard projects uses svn:external to include an external module, djblets, and git-svn provides no transparent way to support this.</p>

<p>For now, I manage this manually. When ever I notice an update to djblets (which are thankfully rather rare), I use the following process to merge the changes into a branch (<a href="http://git.mojain.com/w/mirrors/reviewboard.git?a=shortlog;h=with-djblets">with-djblets</a>) in the git repo:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; cd ~/src/djblets
&#036; git svn rebase
&#036; git log -1 | grep -v '^commit' &gt; /tmp/djblets.log
</code></pre>

<p>Note: change &#8220;1&#8221; to whatever number of commits have happened in djblets since the last time I did this. The grep command removes the git-specific &#8220;commit&#8221; lines from the log, which won&#8217;t be interesting enough to include in the commit message below.</p>

<pre><code>&#036; cd ~/src/reviewboard-with-djblets
&#036; git status # make sure working dir is clean
&#036; cp -rp ~/src/djblets/* reviewboards/djblets/
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, I do a <code>git status</code> and manual sanity check to make sure the changes I&#8217;m about to commit here match the incoming change to djblets.</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git add &lt;files that are changed/new&gt;
&#036; git commit -F /tmp/djblets.log
&#036; git push public-repo with-djblets
</code></pre>

<p>Done! Simple, no? Well, no&#8230; This process has a number of problems, the main one of which is it&#8217;s manual, and <em>I</em> have to do it. I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ll be able to bend <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html">git-submodule</a> to my will enough to take care of this.</p>

caching its date. This is problematic if the file is moved (e.g. your
data dir is different locally to on your web server).</p>

<p>This patch normalises the key to remove the &#8220;datadir&#8221; component. It
also cleans up how the cache is written to disk:</p>

<h2><a href="http://mikerowecode.com/2007/10/leopard_git_ssh.html">Leopard breaking MacPorts git over ssh</a></h2>
<div class="byline">
  <p>2007-10-30 - 09:43</p>
</div>
<div class="story">
  <p>As I have been <a href="http://twitter.com/mrowe">twitting</a> recently, git over ssh stopped working
for me after the upgrade to Leopard:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; git pull
percent_expand: NULL replacement
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Cannot get the repository state from ssh://git.mojain.com/...
</code></pre>

<p>A quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=leopard+percent_expand%3A+NULL+replacement">google search</a> quickly turned up the answer. The problem
was not with git, but with ssh. Spefically, ssh from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>.
It&#8217;s worth noting that ssh in OS X 10.5 is <em>not</em> broken (which made my
intial trouble-shooting harder, as ssh-ing from the command line
worked just fine). But git in MacPorts is:</p>

<pre><code>&#036; which ssh
/usr/bin/ssh
&#036; ssh git.mojain.com
Last login: Mon Oct 29 20:17:47 2007 from ...
&#036; ^D

&#036; /opt/local/bin/ssh git.mojain.com
percent_expand: NULL replacement
</code></pre>

<p>You can follow the google results above for the details, but
essentially it seems that two things cause the git problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Leopard changed some environment variables that caused the MacPorts
version of git to get a NULL when it tried to determine what
&#8220;identity&#8221; to use.</p></li>
<li><p>git looks for ssh in the same directory as the git binary, causing
it to find the MacPorts version before the &#8220;native&#8221; OS X version.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a number of ways to work around this problem (all found in
the aforemetioned google results):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set <code>GIT_SSH</code> to the OS X version (<code>/usr/bin/ssh</code>). This works for
git only of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Rename your ssh key files so MacPorts ssh can find them (I didn&#8217;t
try this).</p></li>
<li><p>Tell ssh which key file to use by adding the following line to
<code>&#036;HOME/.ssh/config</code> (creating that file if it doesn&#8217;t exist):</p>

<p><code>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This last option is the one I chose, as it has the advantage of
working for all versions and invocations of ssh, and is probably a
good idea anyway. Presumably the MacPorts ssh package will be fixed at
some point, but this is working for me now.</p>

<div class="story">
  <p>My upgrade to Leopard has gone mostly well (if you don&#8217;t mind waiting
half a day for spotlight to index everything, then another half a day
for time machine to do its first back up). But tonight I tried to
access my &#8220;personal website&#8221; via the local Apache server, and got a
&#8220;Forbidden&#8221; message.</p>

<p>It turns out Leopard includes Apache 2.2 (up from the 1.3 in Tiger)
and its configuration now lives in</p>

<pre><code>/private/etc/apache2
</code></pre>

<p>(not <code>/private/etc/httpd</code> as in Tiger and earlier). However, the
upgrade did not bring across my user configuration file
(<code>/private/etc/httpd/users/mrowe.conf</code>).</p>

<p>The following commands fixed this for me:</p>

<pre><code>cp /private/etc/httpd/users/mrowe.conf /private/etc/apache2/users/
echo 'Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf' &gt;&gt; /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
apachectl graceful

<p>(Obviously you would use your short username where I have &#8220;<code>mrowe</code>&#8221;.)</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tried PHP yet&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: it turns out adding that <code>Include
/private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf</code> line to <code>httpd.conf</code> is not
necessary. It is taken care of by the line:</p>

<pre><code>Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
</code></pre>

<p>earlier in <code>httpd.conf</code> that I hadn&#8217;t noticed. You still need to copy
your user.conf from <code>/private/etc/httpd/users</code> to
<code>/private/etc/apache2/users</code>.</p>
